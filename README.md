# my_app

A new Flutter project.
This is my first flutter project since 2019 when I first started learning flutter. I didn't feel well writing an app in flutter and encountered a variety of problems building an app using it. I ended up switching to Native Dev. using both Swift & Kotlin. 

Yet here again I'm returning because of 2 reasons: 
 1. is that I missed a great amount of money rejecting clients who wanted to build their apps using it.
 2. IEEE AAST Alex SB has asked me to teach their volunteers flutter development. So I had to practice....

## Getting Started
